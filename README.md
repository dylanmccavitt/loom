# Loom

Loom is a curated, harness-agnostic agent skill pack for turning planning, implementation, review, proof, repair, launch, handoff, and initiative workflows into portable skills that teams can install wherever their coding agents read skill directories.

## Skill roster

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `belt` | Carries durable handoff, thread-control, and resume context with concise state, proof, risks, and next actions. |
| `biters` | Reviews changes adversarially for correctness, regressions, maintainability, scope creep, missing tests, security, and workflow drift. |
| `blueprint` | Shapes specs, issue decompositions, architecture seams, research spikes, tracker triage, and reusable planning templates. |
| `lab` | Runs proof-only command, UI, and smoke validation while recording behavior evidence without expanding scope. |
| `repair-pack` | Fixes exactly one concrete review or proof finding from a fresh compact packet. |
| `roboports` | Coordinates one tracked implementation issue end to end with localized fanout, minimal diffs, refactors, and performance work. |
| `rocket-launch` | Enforces launch gates for ready changes and records the evidence loop for PR merge and tracker closeout handoff. |
| `assembler` | Sets up or refreshes a repo-local workflow kit envelope, harness wiring, repo glossary, commands, templates, and skills. |
| `prospect` | Captures a brand-new idea, feature, or initiative as tracked planning work before a spec or issues exist. |
| `space-age` | Coordinates artifact promotion and cross-repo delivery through ordered CI/CD or dependency hops. |
| `map-seed` | De-risks constrained designs with a fast throwaway prototype, retro, and restarted plan. |

## Install per harness

The fastest route is the bundled installer:

```sh
npm run install:skills
```

On a TTY it opens an interactive picker: choose skills, choose harnesses, review the summary, confirm. Non-interactively, drive it with flags:

```sh
node scripts/install.mjs --harness codex,claude --all --yes
node scripts/install.mjs --harness cursor --skills belt,lab --yes
node scripts/install.mjs --list
```

Claude Code and Codex targets default to symlinks; Cursor and Factory default to copies (`--symlink`/`--copy` override). OMP is config-based, so the installer prints the `skills.customDirectories` snippet instead of writing files. Existing targets that were not installed by Loom are skipped with a warning unless `--force` is passed, and `--dry-run` prints the plan without writing.

Manual routes, for reference:

| Harness | Install route | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `ln -s ~/loom/skills ~/.claude/skills` | Plain skill dirs, no plugin needed; symlinks documented-supported. |
| Codex CLI and generic Agent Skills convention | `ln -s ~/loom/skills ~/.agents/skills` | Symlinked folders documented-supported. |
| Cursor | Reads `~/.agents/skills` or `~/.cursor/skills` | Symlink support undocumented — verify in Skills UI; copy if not listed. |
| OMP | `skills.customDirectories: [~/loom/skills]` | No symlink needed. |
| Factory Droid | Copy into `~/.factory/skills` | Symlink behavior undocumented. |

### Validators

| Validator | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nucleus docs drift | `node scripts/validate-nucleus-docs-drift.mjs` | Keeps README identity, commands, script citations, and test-suite rows aligned with package scripts and files on disk. |
| Skill validation | `node scripts/validate-skills.mjs` | Checks skill shape, frontmatter, naming, and secret-like content. |

### Scripts

| Script | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Benchmark harness | `node scripts/bench.mjs` | Runs repository benchmark checks. |
| Skill installer | `node scripts/install.mjs` | Links or copies `skills/` into harness skill directories, interactively or via flags. |
| Operator loop | `node scripts/loop.mjs` | Runs the offline loop entrypoint. |
| Retro packet helper | `node scripts/retro-packet.mjs` | Handles retro packet maintenance. |
| Worktree guard | `node scripts/worktree-guard.mjs` | Confirms agent work starts in the intended checkout. |

### Release asset

The release tarball ships only `skills/`, `docs/agent-contract.md`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `RELEASE-NOTES.md`. Development tooling lives only in the repository.
