# Loom

Loom is a curated, harness-agnostic agent skill pack for turning planning, implementation, review, proof, repair, launch, handoff, and initiative workflows into portable skills that teams can install wherever their coding agents read skill directories.

## Skill roster

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `belt` | Carries durable handoff, thread-control, and resume context with concise state, proof, risks, and next actions. |
| `biters` | Reviews changes adversarially for correctness, regressions, maintainability, scope creep, missing tests, security, and workflow drift. |
| `blueprint` | Shapes specs, issue decompositions, architecture seams, research spikes, tracker triage, and reusable planning templates. |
| `lab` | Runs proof-only command, UI, and smoke validation while recording behavior evidence without expanding scope. |
| `repair-pack` | Fixes exactly one concrete review or proof finding from a fresh compact packet. |
| `roboports` | Coordinates one tracked implementation issue end to end with localized fanout, minimal diffs, refactors, and performance work. |
| `rocket-launch` | Enforces launch gates for ready changes and records the evidence loop for PR merge and tracker closeout handoff. |
| `assembler` | Sets up or refreshes a repo-local workflow kit envelope, harness wiring, repo glossary, commands, templates, and skills. |
| `prospect` | Captures a brand-new idea, feature, or initiative as tracked planning work before a spec or issues exist. |
| `space-age` | Coordinates artifact promotion and cross-repo delivery through ordered CI/CD or dependency hops. |
| `map-seed` | De-risks constrained designs with a fast throwaway prototype, retro, and restarted plan. |

## Install per harness

The fastest route is the bundled installer:

```sh
npm run install:skills
```

On a TTY it opens an interactive picker: choose skills, choose harnesses, review the summary, confirm. Non-interactively, drive it with flags:

```sh
node scripts/install.mjs --harness codex,claude --all --yes
node scripts/install.mjs --harness cursor --skills belt,lab --yes
node scripts/install.mjs --list
```

Every harness defaults to symlink except `cursor` and `factory` (copy, because symlink support is undocumented) and `omp` (config snippet only); `--symlink`/`--copy` override. OMP is config-based, so the installer prints the `skills.customDirectories` snippet instead of writing files. Existing targets that were not installed by Loom are skipped with a warning unless `--force` is passed, and `--dry-run` prints the plan without writing. Global target paths follow the skills.sh supported-agents matrix.

### Validators

| Validator | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nucleus docs drift | `node scripts/validate-nucleus-docs-drift.mjs` | Keeps README identity, commands, script citations, and test-suite rows aligned with package scripts and files on disk. |
| Skill quality | `node scripts/validate-skill-quality.mjs` | Enforces word/description budgets, bans filler phrases and vendor tracker names, and requires eval coverage; existing violations are grandfathered in `scripts/skill-quality-allowlist.json`, a ratchet that may only shrink. |
| Skill validation | `node scripts/validate-skills.mjs` | Checks skill shape, frontmatter, naming, and secret-like content. |

### Release asset

The release tarball ships only `skills/`, `docs/agent-contract.md`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `RELEASE-NOTES.md`. Development tooling lives only in the repository.
