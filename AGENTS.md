# AGENTS.md

Loom (oh-my-pi-config) is a declarative, dry-run-safe nucleus harness unifying OMP, Codex, and Claude agent configuration. The repo tracks only portable declarative surfaces; runtime state stays in `~/.omp`, `~/.codex`, `~/.claude` and is never written by default.

## Commands

- `npm run check` - full gate: all validators, inventory, safety gate, then unit tests. Run before completing any task.
- `npm test` - unit tests only (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`)
- `npm run validate` - validators + dry-run inventory + safety gate
- `npm run doctor` - environment/health check
- `npm run render-nucleus` - dry-run render of all candidates (writes nothing live)
- `npm run install-nucleus` - gated apply (`--write`); create-missing-only, requires clean dry run
- `npm run factory -- scan --root <repo>` / `init-envelope --root <repo>` - Factory Nucleus envelope tooling

Node >= 20, ESM (`type: module`), no external runtime dependencies.

## Layout

- `nucleus/` - canonical, model-agnostic source for agents and skills. **Edit here first.**
  - `nucleus/skills/<agent>/` - one Vercel-shaped package per canonical agent (SKILL.md, AGENTS.md, references/ with lens files, exemplars/). Exactly 7 roster agents: `blueprint` (shape), `roboports` (implement), `biters` (review), `lab` (prove), `repair-pack` (repair), `rocket-launch` (launch), `belt` (handoffs). Behavioral variants are lens references selected by the packet `lens` field.
  - `nucleus/utilities/<skill>/` - non-roster utility skills (tdd, debug-tools, assembler, prospect, space-age, security-*, etc.)
  - `nucleus/agents/shared-nucleus-agents.md` - shared agent contract: request modes, pipeline DAG, lens policy, packet contract, decision authority
- `adapters/` - harness-specific translators (omp, codex, claude, plugin-bridge). Adapters translate format only; never change canonical names, routing, or behavior.
- `distributions/` - generated/checkable output and OMP reference snapshots. Never hand-edit generated output.
- `.agents/skills/` - rendered compatibility surface generated from `nucleus/skills/`; edit `nucleus/skills/` instead.
- `.factory/droids/` - Factory harness adapters for the canonical agent roster; thin routers to `nucleus/skills/<agent>/`.
- `docs/harness/resource-manifest.md` - canonical dispositions: `track`, `adapt`, `reference-only`, `local-only`.
- `scripts/` - validators, renderers, and the read-only safety gate (`dry-run-harness-safety-gate.mjs`).

## Agent roster

When work matches a canonical agent role (see the roster table in `nucleus/agents/shared-nucleus-agents.md`), load that agent's package from `nucleus/skills/<agent>/` and follow its mode boundaries. Resolve request mode (`shape`, `implement`, `review`, `prove`, `repair`, `launch`) and lens before acting; when the packet names a lens, load only that lens reference.

## Hard rules

- Dry-run first, always. No live writes to `~/.omp`, `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, or real HOME without the explicit gated `--write` flow and human approval.
- `local-only` surfaces (auth, sessions, histories, caches, DBs, logs) must never be read into the repo or committed.
- No secrets, private home paths, or runtime state in tracked source or plan data; the safety gate rejects these.
- One issue, one branch/worktree, one PR. Linear is the tracker (LOO-* issues); prefix commits with the issue id, e.g. `LOO-151: ...`.
- Never merge PRs or close Linear issues autonomously; launch gates record evidence, the tracker bridge owns closeout.
- Generated distributions are derived from nucleus source at render time; fix the source, then re-render.

## Verification

Before finishing: `npm run check` must pass. For harness-surface changes also confirm `npm run render-nucleus` dry run reports `Result: passed`.
