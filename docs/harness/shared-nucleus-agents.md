# Shared nucleus agent contract

Issues: LOO-96 base contract; LOO-97 autonomous delegation DAG; LOO-98 repair-pack finding-fix loop. Status: contract-only. This document defines the canonical shared agent model; it does not render or activate native OMP, Codex, or Claude agent files.

Source pattern: [Teaching agents product design at Vercel](https://vercel.com/blog/teaching-agents-product-design-at-vercel).

## Mapping decision

Vercel describes one repo-local `product-design` skill with `AGENTS.md`, `SKILL.md`, focused `references/`, `exemplars/`, eval fixtures, and a human-reviewed update loop.

Loom has a multi-agent nucleus, so the adapted target is **one Vercel-shaped skill package per canonical nucleus agent**, not one giant shared super-skill and not flat `omp-*` role ports.

Each future agent package should have this shape:

```text
.agents/skills/{agent-name}/
├── AGENTS.md
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── agent-judgment.md
│   ├── rules.md
│   ├── patterns.md
│   ├── glossary.md
│   └── coverage-gaps.md
└── exemplars/
    └── pr-{name}.md
```

Shared cross-agent references such as delegation DAGs, review/proof policy, repair-pack rules, and harness surfaces may live in a common harness reference area, but each agent entrypoint must route to the narrowest relevant source instead of duplicating broad guidance.

## Model

- Skills remain routing, playbooks, triggers, guardrails, references, exemplars, and stable rules.
- Agents are delegated specialists that execute bounded work packets selected by request mode and source routing.
- Harness adapters may translate file format or frontmatter only; names, behavior contracts, routing, references, and packets stay canonical.
- Deterministic checks handle mechanical rules when code can identify the failure and suggest a concrete fix.
- Judgment stays in agent guidance with evidence, explicit assumptions, exceptions, and coverage gaps.

## Naming rules

- Use Factorio workflow nouns.
- Do not use harness prefixes such as `omp-`, `codex-`, or `claude-`.
- Do not treat direct OMP bundled-agent role ports as the target model.
- The same canonical agent roster must be usable across OMP, Codex, Claude, and future model harnesses.

## Request modes

Every `SKILL.md` resolves mode before acting so audits do not become edits and proof does not become implementation.

| Mode | Purpose | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shape` | Design workflow, compare alternatives, define acceptance and open decisions. | Do not edit or activate agents unless asked. |
| `implement` | Build or update one scoped agent/workflow feature. | One issue, one branch/worktree, one PR. |
| `review` | Audit source, diff, behavior, or proof. | Report findings; do not edit unless asked. |
| `prove` | Verify behavior and collect evidence. | Proof-only; do not expand scope. |
| `repair` | Fix one concrete finding from a compact packet. | One finding only; no drive-by cleanup. |
| `launch` | Enforce merge/closeout gates. | No red gates; tracker bridge owns closeout. |

## Autonomous delegation DAG

Shared nucleus packages run as a staged DAG, not an ad hoc nested swarm. The parent agent that starts a wave owns integration, conflict resolution, final proof selection, and tracker/PR reporting.

Global policy:

- Maximum autonomous depth is 3: root issue/PR owner at depth 0, each child wave increments depth by one.
- Stop when depth is exhausted, no allowed child exists for the mode/scope, a packet would widen scope, a coverage gap blocks the decision, proof is red before launch, or native rendering/live HOME apply/merge/closeout is requested in this contract slice.
- Child agents never merge PRs, close Linear issues, apply generated files to live HOME, create native OMP/Codex/Claude agent files in this contract slice, or invent standards when references are missing.
- Every wave transition records parent, child agents, issue/PR id, mode, scope, loaded references, allowed next agents, proof state, and stop reason.

Mode boundaries:

| Mode | Allowed next agents | Forbidden autonomous actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shape` | `blueprint`, `ghosts`, `main-bus`, `science-pack`, `radar`, `belt` | Implement code, render native agents, open launch PRs, merge, close issues. |
| `implement` | `roboports`, `recycler`, `modules`, `lab`, `biters`, `spitters`, `spidertron`, `bus-first`, `repair-pack`, `belt` | Merge PRs, close issues, live HOME apply, delegate outside issue/worktree scope. |
| `review` | `biters`, `spitters`, `bus-first`, `radar`, `main-bus`, `science-pack`, `belt` | Edit code, run broad implementation, merge/close issues, claim proof. |
| `prove` | `lab`, `spidertron`, `radar`, `belt` | Change behavior, add features, mock proof, claim unexercised branches. |
| `repair` | `repair-pack`, `lab` | Fix adjacent cleanup, accept multiple findings, change acceptance criteria, skip named proof, spawn review agents. |
| `launch` | `rocket-launch`, `lab`, `radar`, `belt` | Merge PRs, close Linear issues, live HOME apply, native agent rendering, change scope, bypass tracker bridge. |

Per-agent child lists and wave-advance authority live in `agentDelegation` in `docs/harness/shared-nucleus-agents.json`. Review and proof may fan out in parallel across distinct lenses such as correctness, security, user-visible behavior, minimal diff, and workflow drift. Implementation children may run in parallel only when packets name disjoint files or the parent owns all integration edits.

`roboports` coordinates the implementation loop: implement the scoped issue in one branch/worktree; fan out `lab`, `biters`, `spitters`, and `spidertron` for proof and review; run `bus-first` after the first review/proof wave; send one concrete finding at a time to `repair-pack`; rerun named proof; return a review-ready PR packet to the parent. `rocket-launch` records launch-gate evidence while the tracker bridge owns closeout outside this contract slice.

## Repair-pack finding-fix loop

`repair-pack` is the fresh-context fixer for one concrete review or proof finding. It is a Vercel-shaped per-agent package, but this slice defines only the contract; it does not create native agent files, eval harnesses, or live HOME output.

Required future package shape:

```text
.agents/skills/repair-pack/
├── AGENTS.md
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── repair-pack.md
│   ├── rules.md
│   └── coverage-gaps.md
└── exemplars/
    └── finding-{stable-id}.md
```

`repair-pack` supports only `repair` mode. It may delegate only the named `prove` check to `lab`, with max one child level. It may not spawn review agents, start broad workflow delegation, render native agent files, implement eval harnesses, or live-apply to HOME.

Every repair request uses a finding packet with these required fields: file, symbol, scope, concrete risk, minimal expected fix, proof check, rule/source id, non-goals, and allowed files. Missing source/rule id, missing proof, missing allowed files, or a fix outside the allowed scope is a blocker, not permission to widen the work.

Repair rules:

1. Accept exactly one finding per packet.
2. Start from fresh compact context: issue/PR id, finding packet, relevant excerpts, allowed files, and named proof only.
3. Apply the minimal expected fix; no drive-by cleanup, style-only edits, broad refactors, or acceptance-criteria changes.
4. Rerun the named proof through `lab` or the coordinator.
5. Run `bus-first` again only when the diff changed or the fix risks scope creep.
6. Return changed files, proof result, residual risk, and blocker reason when blocked.

The original implementer is avoided by default to reduce context drag, anchoring, and bias. Consult them only through the coordinator for one narrow question when intent is unrecoverable from issue/code/proof evidence, the minimal fix would alter an owned API/data contract/user workflow, or the allowed files are insufficient and need scope clarification.

Coverage gaps stop or route work. Missing standards go to `references/coverage-gaps.md`, shape questions route to `blueprint`, `main-bus`, or `science-pack`, and deterministic checks are proposed only when the linter-vs-guidance rule passes.

## Decision authority

Resolve conflicts in this order:

1. The user's explicit goal and constraints.
2. Active Linear issue acceptance criteria.
3. Verified repo code/tests and live PR state.
4. Repository-canonical guidance and routed references.
5. Accepted exemplars with stable evidence.
6. Verified adjacent shipped patterns.
7. General heuristics.

## Starter roster

| Agent | Role | Primary modes | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `blueprint` | Spec synthesizer | `shape` | Turns current context into a PRD/spec with acceptance criteria, non-goals, proof plan, and open decisions. |
| `ghosts` | Issue decomposer | `shape` | Splits an approved plan/spec into dependency-ordered Linear issues and sub-issues. |
| `inserter` | Triage router | `shape`, `review` | Classifies, prioritizes, labels, and routes incoming tracker work. |
| `roboports` | Issue delivery coordinator | `implement` | Runs one tracked issue through branch/worktree, implementation, proof, review, and PR readiness. |
| `radar` | Drift scanner | `review`, `prove` | Checks repo/tracker/proof drift and recommends the next route without mutating state. |
| `lab` | Proof specialist | `prove` | Runs proof-only validation and records behavior evidence without expanding scope. |
| `biters` | General adversarial reviewer | `review` | Attacks correctness, regression, maintainability, scope, and missing-test risks before merge. |
| `spitters` | Security attacker | `review` | Runs AppSec/adversarial security review across trust boundaries and abuse paths. |
| `spidertron` | UI workflow tester | `prove`, `review` | Drives browser/desktop UI workflows and captures user-visible proof. |
| `bus-first` | Minimal-diff tightener | `review` | Applies reuse-before-build doctrine and flags needless abstraction or scope creep. |
| `repair-pack` | Narrow finding fixer | `repair` | Fixes exactly one concrete review/proof finding from a fresh compact packet. |
| `main-bus` | Architecture seam planner | `shape`, `review` | Plans shared lanes/seams so features plug into existing structure instead of parallel spaghetti. |
| `science-pack` | Research spike | `shape`, `review` | Resolves one open unknown with source-grounded findings before build. |
| `belt` | Handoff carrier | `shape`, `review` | Moves durable context between agents/threads with concise state, proof, risks, and next actions. |
| `recycler` | Behavior-preserving refactorer | `implement` | Deletes, consolidates, or clarifies existing code without changing behavior. |
| `modules` | Measured performance optimizer | `implement`, `prove` | Optimizes a proven bottleneck with before/after measurement and stops when returns diminish. |
| `rocket-launch` | Launch gatekeeper | `launch` | Records launch-gate readiness after review/proof/CI gates and tracker bridge evidence are satisfied. |

## Rule and evidence schema

Rules use stable IDs and cite their source:

```markdown
## rule/{stable-id}
Status: proposed | accepted | rejected
Scope:
Rule:
Why:
Exceptions:
Source:
Bad example:
Good example:
Assumptions:
Open decisions:
```

Missing or unverified guidance belongs in `references/coverage-gaps.md`, not in an agent's implicit behavior.

## Linter vs agent guidance

Use deterministic checks when all are true:

1. Code can identify the failure without rendering.
2. The rule avoids likely false positives.
3. The violation has a concrete fix.

Use agent guidance when the decision needs workflow/codebase context, the rule would need many exceptions, or the standard is new/policy-bearing. For either path, add an exemplar or eval that can catch regressions.

## Evidence-intake and decision log

Guidance changes follow the Vercel-style collector -> judge -> human review loop:

1. Collector gathers messages, links, files, and nearby context. It does not score candidates or propose rules.
2. Judge validates sources, separates facts from inferences/open questions, groups candidates, and keeps them pending.
3. Human review chooses the narrowest destination: rule, reference, exemplar, lint rule, eval, coverage gap, or no change.
4. Accepted changes record scope, rationale, evidence, exceptions, approver, and checks.

## Packet contract

Every agent receives a bounded input packet and returns a bounded output packet. The machine-readable packet fields for each agent live in `docs/harness/shared-nucleus-agents.json`. Common invariants:

- report mode, target surface, loaded references, rule IDs, proof run, and unresolved coverage gaps;
- no live HOME apply;
- no scope widening beyond the packet;
- no issue closeout or PR merge in this contract slice; launch records gates for the tracker bridge;
- no native harness agent rendering in this contract slice.

## Superseded direct OMP-role candidates

- `omp-designer` (Codex) — direct OMP designer role port; future UI workflow proof belongs to shared `spidertron` and routed references.
- `omp-planner` (Codex) — direct OMP planning role port; future planning work is split across `blueprint`, `ghosts`, `roboports`, and `main-bus`.
- `omp-reviewer` (Codex) — direct OMP reviewer role port; future review work is split across `biters`, `spitters`, `bus-first`, `lab`, and stable rule citations.
- `omp-librarian` (Codex) — potential OMP research role port; future research belongs to shared `science-pack` and source-grounded references.

These candidates may remain as historical adapter-plan context until a cleanup issue retires them from active renderer paths. They are not the desired shared nucleus agent model.
