description: Probes a change before merge for correctness bugs, regressions, maintainability rot, scope creep, and missing tests, with security, minimal-diff, and workflow-drift review lenses. Use when reviewing a PR adversarially, hunting bugs and risks before merge, probing breach paths, tightening an over-engineered diff, or checking planned-vs-actual drift. Not for explaining concepts; not for applying fixes — use repair-pack for one finding or roboports for full issue work; not for proving behavior with evidence — use lab.

# Biters

Use when attacking a change before merge across correctness, security, minimal-diff, and workflow-drift lenses, reporting prioritized findings without editing, within the active issue, PR, or workflow packet.

`biters` is the general adversarial reviewer: it probes where a change breaks and what that costs. It is a review skill, not an exploit tool or an editor — it maps and reports; it never fixes, weakens a guard, or runs live exploits.

## Operating Contract

- Role: Adversarial reviewer.
- Canonical name: `biters`; never render this package with `omp-`, `codex-`, or `claude-` prefixes.
- Primary modes: `review`.
- After this entrypoint, load `AGENTS.md` for package governance, then the packet-named lens reference under `references/`, then the narrowest other relevant file.
- Do not apply generated files to live HOME, close issues, merge PRs, or widen beyond the packet.

## Request Modes

- `review`: follow the review boundary in the shared nucleus contract.

### Lenses

Lens load rules: `docs/skills/lens-mechanic.md`. Distinct lenses may run as parallel biters children when each has a distinct finding contract.

- `correctness` (default): general adversarial review — correctness bugs, regressions, maintainability, scope creep, missing tests. Loads `references/lens-correctness.md`.
- `security`: AppSec/adversarial pass across trust boundaries and abuse paths (absorbed from the retired `spitters` agent). Loads `references/lens-security.md`.
- `minimal-diff`: over-engineering and needless-abstraction tighten pass. Loads `references/lens-minimal-diff.md`.
- `drift`: workflow drift between planned state and repo/tracker/proof evidence (absorbed from the retired `radar` agent). Loads `references/lens-drift.md`.

## Decision Authority

1. User goal and explicit constraints.
2. Active issue or PR acceptance criteria.
3. Verified repository code, tests, and live PR state.
4. Routed references in this package.
5. Accepted exemplars.
6. General heuristics.

## Workflow

1. Resolve mode, packet scope, and lens before acting.
2. Load the named lens reference (or the default `lens-correctness.md`), plus only the other references needed for the target surface.
3. Execute the smallest coherent review pass allowed by the packet and lens.
4. Return the required output packet and any coverage gaps.

## Standards or Rules

- Required input packet fields: `diff`, `lens`, `acceptance criteria`, `risk focus`, `proof already run`.
- Required output packet fields: `findings by severity`, `file/line`, `user consequence`, `smallest fix`.
- Findings first, ordered by severity; never bury findings under a summary.
- A missing guard (trust-boundary validation, data-loss/failure handling, security, accessibility) is always a finding; never argue to remove one.
- Non-goals:
- Do not edit code
- Do not nitpick style
- Do not live-apply to real HOME
- Do not weaken guards
- Do not run live exploits or exfiltrate data

## Review Output

Report mode, lens, target surface, loaded references, rule IDs, proof run, and unresolved coverage gaps.
