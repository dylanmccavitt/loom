# Logic Run

A tiny interactive terminal app that lets the user drive a state model by hand.
Use this when the question is about **business logic, state transitions, or data
shape** — the kind of thing that looks reasonable on paper but only feels wrong
once you push it through real cases.

## When this is the right shape

- "I'm not sure if this state machine handles the edge case where X then Y."
- "Does this data model actually let me represent the case where..."
- "I want to feel out what the API should look like before writing it."
- Anything where the user wants to **press buttons and watch state change**.

If the question is "what should this look like" — wrong branch. Use [UI.md](UI.md).

## Process

### 1. State the question and the constraints

Before writing code, write down the state model, the question you're prototyping,
and the **fixed constraints you're planning around** (a legacy API you must call,
a schema you don't own, a data shape you can't change). One paragraph, in the
prototype's README or a comment at the top of the file. A logic run that answers
the wrong question — or ignores the terrain it has to live on — is pure waste.
Make both explicit so they can be checked later, whether the user is watching now
or returning to it AFK.

### 2. Pick the language

Use whatever the host project uses. If the project has no obvious runtime (e.g. a
docs repo), ask. Match the project's existing conventions for tooling — don't add
a new package manager or runtime just for the run.

### 3. Isolate the logic in a portable module

Put the actual logic — the bit that's answering the question — behind a small,
pure interface that could be lifted out and dropped into the real codebase later.
The TUI around it is throwaway; the logic module shouldn't be.

The right shape depends on the question:

- **A pure reducer** — `(state, action) => state`. Good when actions are discrete
  events and state is a single value.
- **A state machine** — explicit states and transitions. Good when "which actions
  are even legal right now" is part of the question.
- **A small set of pure functions** over a plain data type. Good when there's no
  implicit current state — just transformations.
- **A class or module with a clear method surface** when the logic genuinely owns
  ongoing internal state.

Where the question touches a fixed constraint, **mock or stub it** behind the same
pure interface — an in-memory fake of the legacy API, a hardcoded sample of the
data you can't fetch yet — so the run answers its question without depending on
the awkward piece.

Pick whichever shape best fits the question being asked, *not* whichever is
easiest to wire to a TUI. Keep it pure: no I/O, no terminal code, no
`console.log` for control flow. The TUI imports it and calls into it; nothing
flows the other direction. This is what makes the run useful past its own
lifetime — the validated reducer / machine / function set can be lifted into the
real module, and the TUI shell deleted.

### 4. Build the smallest TUI that exposes the state

Build it as a **lightweight TUI** — on every tick, clear the screen
(`console.clear()` / `print("\033[2J\033[H")` / equivalent) and re-render the
whole frame. The user should always see one stable view, not an ever-growing
scrollback.

Each frame has two parts, in this order:

1. **Current state**, pretty-printed and diff-friendly (one field per line, or
   formatted JSON). Use **bold** for field names or section headers and **dim**
   for less important context (timestamps, IDs, derived values). Native ANSI
   escape codes are fine — `\x1b[1m` bold, `\x1b[2m` dim, `\x1b[0m` reset. No
   styling library unless one is already in the project.
2. **Keyboard shortcuts**, listed at the bottom: `[a] add user  [d] delete user
   [t] tick clock  [q] quit`. Bold the key, dim the description, or vice-versa.

Behaviour:

1. **Initialise state** — a single in-memory object/struct. Render the first
   frame on start.
2. **Read one keystroke (or one line)** at a time, dispatch to a handler that
   mutates state.
3. **Re-render** the full frame after every action — don't append, replace.
4. **Loop until quit.**

The whole frame should fit on one screen.

### 5. Make it runnable in one command

Add a script to the project's existing task runner (`package.json` scripts,
`Makefile`, `justfile`, `pyproject.toml`). The user should run
`pnpm run <run-name>` or equivalent — never need to remember a path. If the host
project has no task runner, put the command at the top of the run's README.

### 6. Hand it over and retro

Give the user the run command. They'll drive it themselves; the interesting
moments are when they say "wait, that shouldn't be possible" or "huh, I assumed X
would be different" — those are the bugs in the *idea*, which is the whole point.
If they want new actions added, add them. Runs evolve. Then **retro**: what
worked, what didn't, what to keep — and if the footing was doomed, reroll into a
fresh run rather than patching this one.

### 7. Capture the answer

When the run has done its job, the answer to the question is the only thing worth
keeping. If the user is around, ask what it taught them. If not, leave a
`NOTES.md` next to the run so the answer can be filled in (or filled in by you, if
you've watched the session) before the run gets deleted. The answer folds into
`blueprint`; the code does not.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't add tests.** A run that needs tests is no longer a throwaway.
- **Don't wire it to the real database.** Use an in-memory store unless the
  question is specifically about persistence.
- **Don't generalise.** No "what if we wanted to support X later." The run
  answers one question.
- **Don't blur the logic and the TUI together.** If the reducer / state machine
  references `console.log`, prompts, or terminal escape codes, it's no longer
  portable. Keep the TUI as a thin shell over a pure module.
- **Don't ship the TUI shell into production.** The shell is optimised for being
  driven by hand from a terminal; the logic module behind it is the bit worth
  keeping.
