description: Shapes current context into a PRD/spec with acceptance criteria, non-goals, and a proof plan; covers issue decomposition, architecture seams, research spikes, and tracker triage through lenses; owns the kit's reusable PR, issue, project-doc, and PRD templates. Use for writing a PRD/spec, breaking a plan into issues, planning structure, resolving unknowns, triaging incoming issues, or fetching a PR/issue/doc template. Not for implementing a ready tracked issue — use roboports; not for throwaway prototypes — use map-seed; not for landing a brand-new idea's tracker home — use prospect.

# Blueprint

`blueprint` owns **shape** work: draft a PRD/spec with acceptance criteria, non-goals, and a proof plan; through lenses also decompose plans into tracked issues, plan architecture seams, run research spikes, and triage incoming issues. It owns the reusable templates the kit stamps into repos and the tracker.

## Lenses

Lens load rules: `docs/skills/lens-mechanic.md`.

- `spec-synthesis` (default) — synthesize a PRD/spec from current context.
- `issue-decomposition` — split a plan/spec into dependency-ordered tracked
  issues (tracer-bullet vertical slices).
- `architecture` — plan shared lanes/seams and record the minimal restructure
  as an ADR/doc.
- `research-spike` — resolve one open unknown with source-grounded,
  time-boxed findings.
- `triage` — classify and route incoming tracked issues through the envelope's
  state machine.

The tracker is the planning system of record; code lands as a PR. The spec
lands as a tracker **document** on the project `prospect` created — not as a
repo file or a code-host issue.

## Required reading

Before drafting, read the repo envelope `assembler` generated:
the tracker team/project/label map, the **domain glossary**, the commands, and the
template set. Do not hardcode a tracker, team, labels, or commands — read the envelope.
Also read the originating `prospect` idea/brief and any research-spike findings document.

## Synthesize, never interview

Produce the spec from context you already have — the conversation, the idea doc, the
research notes, and the codebase. **Do not interview the user.** If a genuine unknown
blocks the spec, switch to the research-spike lens to resolve it rather than
relitigating intent here.
Use the domain glossary's vocabulary for every term in the spec.

## Write the spec (PRD)

Draft from `templates/prd.md`. The spec MUST include:

- a problem statement and solution in the user's terms,
- explicit **acceptance criteria** (observable, testable),
- explicit **non-goals** (what it will not do),
- a **proof plan** (how an agent proves each criterion without expanding scope; prefer
  the highest existing test seam).

Keep it prose. No file paths or code snippets — they rot. The one exception: a
decision-encoding snippet (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape) inlined where
prose is less precise, trimmed to the decision-rich parts. If a throwaway prototype is
needed to de-risk a decision, route to `map-seed` first, then fold its findings (and any
such snippet) into the spec.

## Publish to the tracker

Publish the finished spec as a tracker **document** on the prospect's project via
`save_document`. Return the created document id/link. The document is the spec's home;
the issue-decomposition lens reads it to cut issues.

## Templates

This skill owns the kit's starter templates under `templates/`; `assembler` stamps
repo-local and tracker-side copies from them. Keep them generic and placeholder-driven —
never bake in repo-specific facts or secrets.

- `templates/prd.md` — the spec/PRD blueprint.
- `templates/linear-project-doc.md` — a tracker project-document scaffold.
- `templates/linear-issue.md` — an issue-description scaffold (the issue-decomposition lens stamps it).
- `templates/pull-request.md` — a PR scaffold encoding the bridge (branch carries the
  tracked issue id; the merge auto-closes the issue).

## Routing

- New idea with no tracker home yet → `prospect` first; blueprint specs onto its project.
- Unknowns that must be resolved before specifying → the research-spike lens.
- A design that must be felt before it is specified → `map-seed`; fold its findings back.
- Turning the finished spec into tracked work → the issue-decomposition lens. **The spec-synthesis lens never creates issues** — when asked to "create the issues now", switch lenses.
- Implementing a spec'd issue → `roboports` (reviewed against the biters minimal-diff lens).
